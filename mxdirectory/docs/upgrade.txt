Upgrade Instructions
**Backup your database, customized templates and module files before upgrading.

UPGRADE From xdirectory CURRENTLY DOES NOT SUPPORT DIRECTORY NAME CHANGE.
Upgrades from an existing xdirectory install will have to retain the current directory name.
If you have already changed the name, the upgrade will support the directory's current name.

Quick Start UPGRADE INSTRUCTIONS:
1) Upload or unpack the contents of the mxdirectory folder to your /modules/mxdirectory folder.
2) Log in to your site as admin.
3) Go to:
    http://[your-xoopsroot]/modules/[your-mxdirectory-name]/admin/upgrade.php.
4) If successful you should see:
    Upgrade Complete - Update module templates and blocks
5) If you don't see ^ that ^ post the results to the support or bug tracker at:
    http://dev.xoops.org/modules/xfmod/tracker/?group_id=1223
6) Click the 'Update module templates and blocks' link
7) Click the upgrade button
8) Regenerate ANY/ALL mxdirectory custom templates.

Additional Upgrade Information.
The upgrade scripts add tables and fields to the existing xdir_ tables.  For specific information see upgrade.sql
Nothing is omitted from any of the existing xdir_ tables, only additions.
This upgrade should not affect existing categories, sub-cats, listings, logos, or premium service levels.
Your existing data will not be overwitten or erased as a result of the process listed above.

The templates have changed considerably from previous releases.  It is highly recommended that you review the
new templates prior to overwriting them with previously modified templates.  In many cases a "merge" of the old
template into the new template will give better results than attempting to 'hack in' the new template variables
into previous templates.

If you experience difficulties with the process,  post to the support or bug tracker at:
    http://dev.xoops.org/modules/xfmod/tracker/?group_id=1223
